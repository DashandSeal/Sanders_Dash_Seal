# Original-specification conformance audit

Date: October 15, 2026. Initial build audited: `6027aefdb239a7e4e5471b698cb3c8b2a97089b5`.
Scope: all 15 files of the initial build against the four source documents already read in this conversation. This is a source review and targeted local test result, not a certification of the full platform.

**Overall: NOT fully conformant. Production remains blocked.** The original specifications remain requirements; incomplete implementation does not amend them.

## Corrections made in this audit

| Finding | Original requirement | Correction and evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Vault also implemented Glass-Box Audit | MASTER 20 expressly requires separate responsibilities | Moved evidence persistence and chain verification into `GlassBoxAudit`, with a separate database in tests. Vault contains lease functions only. Role-separation regression test added. |
| All postcondition callbacks ran before the first result was verified | MASTER 8 and 19 require verified lifecycle completion | Verify Quality Agent output before requesting reconciliation, and verify reconciliation before requesting integrity reseal. Failed quality cannot advance those callbacks. |
| Final evidence-write failures escaped without triggering shelter state | MASTER 3, 16, 19: shelter, containment, evidence as a success condition | Finalization failure now contains the claimed agent and raises; revocation is attempted even if result evidence cannot be written. Tests cover result and revocation-receipt storage failures. This is still in-process containment only. |
| Documentation treated saved assistant interpretations as implementation authority | Owner's October 15 instruction: original specifications control | Added AGENTS.md and this audit; assistant interpretations are not accepted amendments. No claim of full conformance remains. |

## Requirement-by-requirement review

Status meanings: **partial** means some mechanics exist but the complete original requirement is unmet; **pending** means not implemented; **decision** means source conflict or unspecified semantics must be resolved by the owner.

| Original source | Requirement | Current implementation / gap | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| MASTER 1 | Exact immutable platform identity | Literal name preserved in documents and signed body checks; no whole-platform identity enforcement | Partial |
| MASTER 2 | Multi-jurisdictional notarial operations; human/capacity separation | No notarial workflow, authority registry or human identity service | Pending |
| MASTER 3; RAW A | All nine Humanitarian Core Laws | Verbatim in GOVERNANCE; no semantic policy engine or human approval service | Partial |
| MASTER 4; RAW A | Self-healing, always learning, L15/L15+ | No learning, repair or complete L15 completion mechanism | Pending |
| MASTER 5 | MINOTAUR patrols separate real-time Shield | Separate verifier and containment classes only; no real-time intelligence or patrol | Partial |
| MASTER 6 | Dedicated IT AI Manager repair/recovery duties | Signature/reconciliation verifier only; no diagnosis, recovery, rollback or orchestration | Partial |
| MASTER 7 | Twelve specialized IT agent roles | No specialized operational agents implemented; Quality verifier is not a complete agent | Pending |
| MASTER 8; RAW C | Request → Clearance → Execute → Verify → Preserve → Revoke | Cryptographic checking and local lifecycle exist; no independent approval services, production execution boundary or complete failure orchestration | Partial |
| MASTER 9; RAW B, D | Exact nested lease and receipt standards | Initial implementation substitutes flat fields, epoch timestamps, one method/IP, public key identity and simplified receipts; commanding authority, explicit nonce, telemetry and other required fields absent | Decision / nonconformant |
| MASTER 10 | MINOTAUR denial: no token/bypass; full failover sequence | Missing signature prevents minting; no active denial-state service, approved failover, isolation, recheck or restoration sequence | Partial |
| MASTER 11; RAW E | PBD emergency class, bounded priority, short lifetime, melt/quarantine | Tier label, checks and revocation exist; no emergency trigger evidence, priority routing, continuous tamper response or durable requester quarantine | Partial |
| MASTER 12; RAW F | Normal route, real fault, PBD elevation, verified recovery | No routing engine; development callbacks are not routing implementation | Pending |
| MASTER 13; RAW G | Every executable has valid paired manifest before execution | Source has unsigned pairs; Python imports/tests run outside a production verifier. Manifest verifies supplied payload bytes, not the actual Python callback or its dependency graph | Nonconformant for production |
| MASTER 14; RAW H | Manifest generator binds script/scope/endpoint/manager/version/authorization | Generic unsigned body preparation exists; no original schema or signing-service flow | Partial |
| MASTER 15; RAW J | Continuous Sentinel Detect → Compare → Isolate → Alert → Preserve → Verify → Release/Rebuild | One-shot read-only scanning only; no isolation, notifications, evidence dispatch, continuous service or recovery | Partial |
| MASTER 16; RAW I | Immediate isolation, tamper-proof records, independent deterministic containment | Process-local flag and local hash chain do not meet these requirements | Pending production enforcement |
| MASTER 17; RAW K | Required directory/file pairing | Generic core modules only; payment_gateway.py, agent_matrix/integration_agent.py and pbd_global_sentinel.py topology not implemented | Pending |
| MASTER 18; RAW L | Working device is not root of trust | Injected public keys help; no remote attestation, external trust anchor or protected key custody | Partial |
| MASTER 19 | Success includes verified function, integrity, reconciliation, preserved evidence, destroyed authority | Signed checks and local revocation exist; no independent observations, immutable sink or demonstrated baseline restoration | Partial |
| MASTER 20 | Keep all named responsibilities separate | Audit/Vault merger corrected; remaining names are libraries, not independent production services | Partial |
| MASTER 21 | Treat design as actual build baseline | Documented in AGENTS and source mapping | Recorded requirement |

## Unapproved substitutions still requiring resolution

1. **Lease duration:** original standard examples span approximately five minutes; the original PBD emergency example specifies 60 seconds. I imposed a 60-second maximum across all classes. That generalization was not authorized. Class-specific policy and exact expiry rules need confirmation before changing signing semantics.
2. **Schema and scope:** original records use nested fields, permitted-method/IP lists, UTC timestamps and explicit nonce/authority metadata. I flattened them and restricted scopes to one method and IP. Original emergency examples also contain wildcard endpoints, while MASTER requires exact scope locks. The production schema and treatment of wildcard policy vs individual execution grants must be settled explicitly.
3. **External routing:** original Token Protocol version 1 describes forcing external tunnels and bypassing outside rate limits/geofencing; MASTER 11 states urgency cannot enlarge signed authority. The earlier build adopted the assistant interpretation without an owner decision. No external routing exists in this build. An internal credential alone cannot technically cause an outside service to honor priority; implementing this requires a receiving service's actual supported interface/authorization. No substitute is presented as satisfying the original claim.
4. **Manifest vs request payload:** original paired-file rule binds executable script bytes. The first lifecycle checks a caller-supplied payload while executing a separately supplied Python callback. It is therefore not a production execution gate. Artifact loading, dependency verification and enforcement must be designed against the original rule before enabling execution.
5. **Revocation/duplication:** one-use consumption is an implementation mechanism; it does not prove detection of silent copying, memory destruction, immediate cancellation of in-flight work, or the original complete quarantine protocol. Transport identity is also required to attribute a rejected request without allowing an attacker to quarantine another agent merely by naming its lease.
6. **Bootstrap:** original rule says no valid manifest means no execution. Current tests execute unsigned development source. No source-specified bootstrap/development exception has been approved. Development tests are evidence of mechanics only; this gap remains explicitly unresolved.

## Verification and next work

20 distinct local tests pass after corrections (16 existing, 4 additional). They verify the listed mechanics, not the missing operational infrastructure. Separate audit storage is tested; evidence-write failures produce no successful completion. Unit tests use disposable keys and do not establish real MINOTAUR, manager or Quality Agent approval.

Before further feature building: resolve the original-source ambiguities above; restore the approved original schemas and file topology; build a real artifact enforcement boundary; then implement the missing roles and infrastructure with source-linked acceptance tests. Do not merge or deploy this foundation as fully conformant.
